~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

String rewriting that I typically do with global find-and-replace, for linguistic writing. I then add morpheme boundaries as I go.

7 	→ 	ʔ

a!&	→	ą́
e!&	→	ę́
i!&	→	į́
o!&	→	ǫ́
u!&	→	ų́

a_&	→	ą̄
e_&	→	ę̄
i_&	→	į̄
o_&	→	ǭ
u_&	→	ų̄

The symbols above should be Unicode. In this version, the vowel characters and tone marks (acute accents and macrons) are single characters, and the ogonek is a combining diacritic. Change this if necessary.
